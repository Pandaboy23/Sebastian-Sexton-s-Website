    David Robert Jones, profesionaly know as David Bowie was born in Brixton, London on the 8th January, 1947 just
    after World War II. He grew up in Bromley, Kent. At school his dancing at school was thought to be strikingly
    imaginative. Later on his father brought him a
    collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little
    Richard.Upon listening to Little Richard's song "Tutti Frutti", Bowie would later say that he had "heard God".
    This is what most people would say inspired him.
